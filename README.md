This project is a deep-dive analysis of Blinkit’s grocery data to extract business insights and recommend actionable strategies. The goal was not just to visualize data, but to use it as a tool to solve real operational and strategic challenges Blinkit might face in a competitive quick-commerce landscape.

## Problem Context

Blinkit, being a last-minute delivery platform, faces intense pressure to deliver fast, maintain customer satisfaction, and stand out among players like Zepto and Swiggy Instamart. From delivery delays during peak hours to underperforming outlet sizes and low-visibility inventory, several business pain points surfaced during the analysis.

## Objective

The aim of this analysis was to:

- Identify hidden patterns affecting customer satisfaction and revenue
- Understand which outlet types, sizes, and item categories contribute most to sales
- Recommend data-backed solutions to improve delivery, retention, and visibility
- Present these insights in an interactive Power BI dashboard that can help in day-to-day and strategic decision-making

## Tools Used

- Power BI (for interactive dashboards and storytelling)
- Excel (for initial data cleaning and pre-processing)

## Key Metrics Analyzed

- Total Sales and Average Sales per Item
- Average Rating of Items
- Number of Unique Items
- Sales by Item Type, Outlet Type, Outlet Size, and Location Tier
- Fat Content Split (Low Fat vs Regular)
- Item Visibility vs Sales Performance
- Outlet Establishment Year and Historical Growth Patterns

## Insights Derived

- Supermarket Type1 drives the majority of revenue, but high-size outlets underperform
- Tier 3 cities generate more sales than Tier 1 and Tier 2, showing untapped potential
- Items with high fat content contribute significantly to revenue
- Items with high visibility do not always result in high sales, indicating the need for smarter promotions
- Delivery performance is inconsistent during peak hours (especially 6–9 PM)

## Business Recommendations

- Optimize delivery during peak hours using dynamic routing
- Open more dark stores in Bangalore and Mumbai to reduce delivery times
- Convert underperforming large outlets into fulfillment hubs
- Run targeted promotions for low-visibility, high-potential items
- Focus more on health-conscious product lines that are already driving strong sales

## Project Outcome

The project helped simulate real-life decision-making scenarios for stakeholders. It shows how sales, customer behavior, and operational inefficiencies can be addressed using data. The Power BI dashboard makes it easy for anyone in the business to understand what's working, what isn't, and where the next focus should be.
